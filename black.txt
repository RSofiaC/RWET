black was always your favorite color 
like the inkwell that beckons the pen 
like the night spangled with a million stars 
like the sleek machine your ego rides 
like the naked thoughts you dare not speak 
 
black was the color you always chose 
to draw attention in a crowd 
to cover the splinters of your personality 
to pave the way for wayward spirits 
to separate you from the sheep 
 
I was always attracted to the blackness 
of the color of your hair 
of those eyes that enticed me 
of the secrets deep within you 
of the magic that enthralled me 
 
but that was when I followed blindly 
down the path to my demise,  
when I drowned a thousand times 
within the depths of those black eyes.
