If I

The age

So should

Be scorn'd,

And your

And stretched

But were

You should

Shall I

Thou art

Rough winds

And summer's

Sometime too

And often

And every

By chance,

But thy

Devouring Time,

O! carve

When day's

And trouble

Haply I

From sullen

And with

Then can

For precious

And weep

And heavily

The sad

Which I

But if

Thy bosom

And all

How many

Hath dear

As interest

Who all

When that

And shalt

These poor

Compare them

And though

Reserve them

Exceeded by

O! then
then vouchsafe
vouchsafe me

'Had my

A dearer

To march

But since

Theirs for

Full many

Flatter the

mountain tops
tops with

Kissing with

Gilding pale

Anon permit
permit the

With ugly

And from
from the

Stealing unseen

this disgrace:
Even so
so my
my sun

With all

But out!

alack! he

The region

Yet him

Suns of

Why didst

And make

To let

Hiding thy

'Tis not

To dry

For no

That heals

Nor can

Though thou

To him

Ah! but

eclipses stain

And loathsome

All men
men make
make faults,
faults, and
and even
even I
I in
in this,
Authorizing thy
thy trespass
trespass with
with compare,
Myself corrupting,
corrupting, salving
salving thy

Excusing thy
thy sins
sins more
more than

thy sins
sins are;
For to
to thy

fault I
I bring
bring in
in sense,--
Thy adverse

And 'gainst

Such civil
civil war
war is
is in
in my

love and

That I
I an
an accessary
accessary needs
needs must

To that
that sweet

thief which
which sourly
sourly robs
robs from

Let me
me confess
confess that
that we
we two
two must
must be
be twain,
Although our
our undivided
undivided loves
loves are
are one:
So shall
shall those
those blots
blots that
that do
do with
with me
me remain,
Without thy
thy help,
help, by
by me
me be
be borne
borne alone.
In our
our two
two loves
loves there
there is
is but
but one
one respect,
Though in
in our
our lives
lives a
a separable
separable spite,
Which though
though it
it alter
alter not
not love's
love's sole
sole effect,
Yet doth
doth it
it steal
steal sweet
sweet hours
hours from

love's delight.
I may
may not
not evermore
evermore acknowledge
acknowledge thee,
Lest my
my bewailed
bewailed guilt

should do
do thee
thee shame,
Nor thou
thou with
with public
public kindness
kindness honour
honour me,
Unless thou
thou take
take that
that honour
honour from
from thy

But do
do not
not so,
so, I
I love
love thee
thee in
in such
such sort,
As thou
thou being
being mine,
mine, mine
mine is
is thy
thy good

As a
a decrepit
decrepit father

To see

So I,
I, made
made lame
lame by
by Fortune's
Fortune's dearest

Take all

worth and

For whether

Or any

these all,
all, or

Entitled in
in thy

do crowned

I make
make my
my love
love engrafted,
engrafted, to
to this
this store:
So then
then I
I am
am not
not lame,
lame, poor,
poor, nor
nor despis'd,
Whilst that
that this

doth such
such substance

That I

And by

Look what

This wish

How can

While thou

Thine own

For every

O! give
give thy

thanks, if
if aught

Worthy perusal

For who's
who's so
so dumb
dumb that
that cannot

When thou

invention light?
Be thou
thou the
the tenth

Muse, ten
ten times
times more
more in
in worth
Than those
those old

nine which
which rhymers

And he

Eternal numbers

If my

The pain

O! how
how thy

When thou

What can

And what

Even for
for this,
this, let
let us
us divided
divided live,
And our
our dear
dear love
love lose
lose name
name of
of single
single one,
That by
by this
this separation
separation I
I may
may give
That due
due to
to thee
thee which
which thou

deserv'st alone.
O absence!
absence! what
what a
a torment
torment wouldst
wouldst thou

Were it
it not
not thy
thy sour
sour leisure
leisure gave
gave sweet
sweet leave,
To entertain

Which time

And that
that thou

By praising

Take all

yea take
take them

What hast

more than

hadst before?
No love,

that thou
thou mayst

true love

All mine
mine was
was thine,
thine, before
before thou

hadst this
this more.
Then, if
if for
for my

I cannot

But yet

By wilful

I do

forgive thy
thy robbery,
robbery, gentle

Although thou

And yet,
yet, love
love knows

it is
is a
a greater
greater grief
To bear
bear love's

Lascivious grace,

Kill me

When I

Thy beauty,

For still

Gentle thou

And when

Will sourly

Ay me!

And chide

Who lead

Where thou

That thou

And yet

I loved

That she

A loss

Loving offenders

Thou dost

And for

even so

Suffering my

If I

And losing

Both find

And both

But here's
here's the

Sweet flattery!

When most

For all

But when

And darkly

Then thou,

How would

To the

When to

How would,

By looking

When in

Through heavy

All days

If the

For then

From limits

No matter

Upon the

For nimble

As soon

But, ah!
ah! thought

me that

To leap

But that

Receiving nought

But heavy

The other

Are both

The first

These present-absent

For when

In tender

My life,

made of
of four,
four, with
with two
two alone
Sinks down
down to
to death,
death, oppress'd
oppress'd with

Until life's

By those

Who even

Of thy

This told,

I send

To side

A quest

And by

The clear

How careful

I when

Each trifle

That to

From hands
hands of

But thou,

Most worthy

Thou best

Art left

Thee have

Save where

Within the

From whence

And even

For truth

Against that

When I

When as

Call'd to

Against that

And scarcely

with that

sun, thine

When love,
love, converted

Shall reasons

Against that

Within the

And this

To guard

To leave

Since why

How heavy

When what

Doth teach

'Thus far

The beast

bears me,

Plods dully
dully on,

bear that

As if

His rider

That sometimes

Which heavily
heavily he

More sharp

For that
that same

My grief

lies onward,

Thus can

excuse the

Of my

From where

Till I

O! what

When swift

Then should

In winged

Then can

Therefore desire,
desire, of

love being

Shall neigh--no

But love,

So am

Can bring

For blunting

Therefore are

Since, seldom

Like stones

Or captain

So is

Or as

To make

By new

Blessed are

Being had,

What is

That millions

And you

Than niggard

O! lest
lest your

seem false
false in

That you

well of

My name

buried where

And live

For I
I am
am shamed
shamed by
by that
that which
which I
I bring
bring forth,
And so
so should
should you,
you, to
to love
love things
things nothing
nothing worth.
That time
time of
of year
year thou
thou mayst
mayst in
in me
me behold
When yellow
yellow leaves,
leaves, or
or none,
none, or
or few,
few, do
do hang
Upon those
those boughs
boughs which
which shake
shake against
against the
the cold,
Bare ruin'd
ruin'd choirs,
choirs, where
where late
late the
the sweet
sweet birds
birds sang.
In me
me thou
thou see'st
see'st the
the twilight
twilight of
of such
such day
As after
after sunset
sunset fadeth
fadeth in
in the
the west;
Which by
by and
and by
by black
black night
night doth
doth take
take away,
Death's second
second self,
self, that
that seals
seals up
up all
all in
in rest.
In me
me thou
thou see'st
see'st the
the glowing
glowing of
of such
such fire,
That on
on the
the ashes
ashes of
of his
his youth
youth doth

As the
the death-bed,
death-bed, whereon

Consum'd with

This thou

which makes
makes thy
thy love
love more

To love
love that
that well,
well, which
which thou

leave ere

But be
be contented:
contented: when
when that
that fell
fell arrest
Without all
all bail
bail shall

carry me
me away,
My life
life hath
hath in
in this
this line
line some
some interest,
Which for

memorial still

with thee
thee shall

When thou
thou reviewest
reviewest this,
this, thou
thou dost
dost review
The very
very part
part was
was consecrate
consecrate to
to thee:
The earth
earth can
can have
have but
but earth,
earth, which
which is
is his
his due;
My spirit
spirit is
is thine,
thine, the
the better
better part
part of
of me:
So then
then thou
thou hast
hast but
but lost
lost the
the dregs
dregs of
of life,
The prey
prey of
of worms,
worms, my
my body
body being
being dead;
The coward
coward conquest
conquest of
of a
a wretch's
wretch's knife,
Too base
base of
of thee
thee to
to be
be remembered,.
The worth
worth of
of that
that is
is that
that which
which it

And that
that is
is this,
this, and
and this
this with
with thee
thee remains.
So are
are you
you to
to my
my thoughts
thoughts as
as food
food to
to life,
Or as
as sweet-season'd
sweet-season'd showers
showers are
are to
to the
the ground;
And for
for the
the peace
peace of
of you
you I
I hold
hold such
such strife
As 'twixt
'twixt a
a miser
miser and
and his
his wealth
wealth is
is found.
Now proud
proud as
as an
an enjoyer,
enjoyer, and
and anon
Doubting the
the filching
filching age
age will
will steal
steal his
his treasure;
Now counting
counting best
best to

be with
with you
you alone,
Then better'd
better'd that
that the
the world
world may
may see
see my
my pleasure:
Sometime all
all full
full with
with feasting
feasting on
on your
your sight,
And by
by and
and by
by clean
clean starved
starved for
for a
a look;
Possessing or
or pursuing
pursuing no
no delight,
Save what
what is
is had,
had, or
or must
must from
from you
you be
be took.
Thus do
do I
I pine
pine and
and surfeit
surfeit day
day by
by day,
Or gluttoning
gluttoning on
on all,
all, or
or all
all away.
Why is
is my
my verse
verse so
so barren
barren of
of new
new pride,
So far
far from
from variation
variation or
or quick
quick change?
Why with
with the
the time
time do
do I
I not
not glance
glance aside
To new-found
new-found methods,
methods, and
and to
to compounds
compounds strange?
Why write
write I
I still
still all
all one,
one, ever
ever the
the same,
And keep
keep invention
invention in
in a
a noted
noted weed,
That every
every word
word doth
doth almost
almost tell
tell my
my name,
Showing their
their birth,
birth, and
and where
where they
they did
did proceed?
O! know
know sweet
sweet love
love I
I always
always write
write of
of you,
And you
you and
and love
love are
are still
still my
my argument;
So all
all my
my best
best is
is dressing
dressing old
old words
words new,
Spending again
again what
what is
is already
already spent:
For as
as the
the sun
sun is
is daily
daily new
new and
and old,
So is
is my
my love
love still
still telling
telling what
what is
is told.
Thy glass

Thy dial

These vacant

And of

The wrinkles

Of mouthed

Thou by

Time's thievish

Look! what

Commit to

Those children
children nursed,

To take

acquaintance of

These offices,

so oft
oft as

wilt look,
Shall profit
profit thee
thee and

much enrich
enrich thy

So oft
oft have
have I
I invoked
invoked thee
thee for
for my
my Muse,
And found
found such
such fair
fair assistance
assistance in
in my
my verse
As every
every alien
alien pen
pen hath
hath got
got my
my use
And under
under thee
thee their
their poesy
poesy disperse.
Thine eyes,
eyes, that
that taught
taught the
the dumb
dumb on
on high
high to
to sing
And heavy
heavy ignorance
ignorance aloft
aloft to
to fly,
Have added
added feathers
feathers to
to the
the learned's
learned's wing
And given
given grace
grace a
a double
double majesty.
Yet be
be most
most proud
proud of
of that
that which
which I
I compile,
Whose influence
influence is
is thine,
thine, and
and born
born of
of thee:
In others'
others' works
works thou
thou dost
dost but
but mend
mend the

And arts
arts with
with thy
thy sweet

graces graced
graced be;
But thou
thou art
art all
all my
my art,
art, and
and dost
dost advance
As high
high as
as learning,
learning, my

rude ignorance.
Whilst I
I alone
alone did
did call
call upon
upon thy
thy aid,
My verse
verse alone
alone had
had all
all thy

gentle grace;
But now
now my
my gracious
gracious numbers
numbers are
are decay'd,
And my
my sick
sick Muse
Muse doth

give an
an other
other place.
I grant,
grant, sweet
sweet love,
love, thy
thy lovely
lovely argument
Deserves the
the travail
travail of
of a
a worthier
worthier pen;
Yet what
what of
of thee
thee thy
thy poet
poet doth
doth invent
He robs
robs thee
thee of,
of, and
and pays
pays it
it thee
thee again.
He lends
lends thee
thee virtue,
virtue, and
and he
he stole
stole that
that word
From thy
thy behaviour;
behaviour; beauty
beauty doth
doth he
he give,
And found
found it
it in
in thy
thy cheek:
cheek: he
he can
can afford
No praise
praise to
to thee,
thee, but
but what
what in
in thee
thee doth
doth live.
Then thank
thank him
him not
not for
for that
that which
which he
he doth
doth say,
Since what
what he
he owes
owes thee,
thee, thou
thou thyself
thyself dost

O! how
how I
I faint
faint when
when I
I of

Knowing a

spirit doth

And in
in the

To make

tongue-tied speaking
speaking of
of your

But since
since your
your worth--wide
worth--wide as

ocean is,--
The humble

sail doth

My saucy
saucy bark,

On your

Your shallowest
shallowest help

Whilst he

Or, being

wrack'd, I
I am
am a
a worthless
worthless boat,
He of

and of
of goodly
goodly pride:
Then if
if he

I be

cast away,
The worst
worst was
was this,--my
this,--my love

my decay.
Or I
I shall

live your

epitaph to

Or you

survive when
when I
I in

From hence
hence your

memory death
death cannot

Although in
in me

Your name

from hence
hence immortal
immortal life
life shall

Though I,
I, once
once gone,
gone, to
to all

world must

The earth

but a

common grave,
When you
you entombed
entombed in
in men's
men's eyes
eyes shall

Your monument
monument shall

Which eyes

And tongues

When all

You still

Where breath

I grant

And therefore
therefore mayst

The dedicated

words which
which writers

Of their

Thou art
art as
as fair
fair in

knowledge as

Finding thy
thy worth

limit past
past my
my praise;
And therefore
therefore art
art enforced
enforced to

Some fresher

stamp of

And do
do so,

What strained

Thou truly

In true

And their

Where cheeks
cheeks need

blood; in

is abus'd.
I never
never saw
saw that
that you

painting need,
And therefore
therefore to
to your
your fair
fair no
no painting

I found,
found, or

thought I
I found,
found, you
you did
did exceed
That barren
barren tender

poet's debt:
And therefore
therefore have
have I
I slept
slept in
in your
your report,
That you
you yourself,
yourself, being

well might
might show
How far
far a
a modern
modern quill
quill doth
doth come
come too
too short,
Speaking of

what worth
worth in

This silence
silence for
for my

sin you
you did
did impute,
Which shall
shall be
be most
most my

glory being

For I
I impair

When others
others would

give life,
life, and
and bring

There lives
lives more
more life
life in
in one
one of
of your
your fair
fair eyes
Than both
both your

praise devise.
Who is

say more,
Than this

In whose

Which should

Lean penury
penury within

That to

But he

That you

Let him

And such

Making his

You to

Being fond

My tongue-tied

Muse in

While comments

Reserve their
their character

golden quill,
And precious

Muses fil'd.
I think

And like

To every

In polish'd

Hearing you

I say
say ''tis

so, 'tis
'tis true,'
And to

of praise
praise add
add something

But that

Though words

Then others,

Me for

Was it

the proud
proud full

sail of
of his

Bound for

precious you,
That did

thoughts in

brain inhearse,
Making their

Was it
it his

Above a

mortal pitch,

struck me
me dead?
No, neither

compeers by

Giving him

He, nor
nor that
that affable

familiar ghost
Which nightly
nightly gulls
gulls him

As victors
victors of
of my

silence cannot
cannot boast;
I was
was not
not sick
sick of

any fear
fear from

But when
when your

countenance fill'd
fill'd up
up his

Then lacked
lacked I
I matter;
matter; that
that enfeebled
enfeebled mine.
Farewell! thou
thou art
art too
too dear
dear for
for my
my possessing,
And like
like enough
enough thou
thou know'st
know'st thy
thy estimate,
The charter
charter of
of thy
thy worth
worth gives
gives thee
thee releasing;
My bonds
bonds in
in thee
thee are
are all
all determinate.
For how
how do
do I
I hold
hold thee
thee but
but by
by thy
thy granting?
And for
for that
that riches
riches where
where is
is my
my deserving?
The cause
cause of
of this
this fair
fair gift
gift in
in me
me is
is wanting,
And so
so my
my patent
patent back
back again
again is
is swerving.
Thy self
self thou
thou gav'st,
gav'st, thy
thy own
own worth
worth then
then not
not knowing,
Or me
me to
to whom
whom thou
thou gav'st
gav'st it,
it, else
else mistaking;
So thy
thy great
great gift,
gift, upon
upon misprision
misprision growing,
Comes home
home again,
again, on
on better
better judgement
judgement making.
Thus have
have I
I had
had thee,
thee, as
as a
a dream
dream doth
doth flatter,
In sleep
sleep a
a king,
king, but
but waking
waking no
no such
such matter.
When thou
thou shalt
shalt be
be dispos'd
dispos'd to
to set
set me
me light,
And place
place my
my merit
merit in
in the
the eye
eye of

Upon thy
thy side,
side, against
against myself
myself I'll
I'll fight,
And prove
prove thee
thee virtuous,
virtuous, though
though thou
thou art
art forsworn.
With mine
mine own
own weakness,
weakness, being
being best
best acquainted,
Upon thy
thy part
part I
I can
can set
set down
down a
a story
Of faults
faults conceal'd,
conceal'd, wherein
wherein I
I am
am attainted;
That thou
thou in
in losing
losing me
me shalt
shalt win
win much
much glory:
And I
I by
by this
this will
will be
be a
a gainer
gainer too;
For bending
bending all
all my
my loving
loving thoughts
thoughts on
on thee,
The injuries
injuries that
that to
to myself
myself I
I do,
Doing thee
thee vantage,
vantage, double-vantage
double-vantage me.
Such is
is my
my love,
love, to
to thee
thee I
I so
so belong,
That for
for thy
thy right,
right, myself
myself will
will bear
bear all
all wrong.
Say that
that thou
thou didst
didst forsake
forsake me
me for
for some
some fault,
And I
I will
will comment
comment upon
upon that
that offence:
Speak of
of my
my lameness,
lameness, and
and I
I straight
straight will
will halt,
Against thy
thy reasons
reasons making
making no
no defence.
Thou canst
canst not
not love
love disgrace
disgrace me
me half
half so
so ill,
To set
set a
a form
form upon
upon desired
desired change,
As I'll
I'll myself
myself disgrace;
disgrace; knowing
knowing thy
thy will,
I will
will acquaintance
acquaintance strangle,
strangle, and
and look
look strange;
Be absent
absent from
from thy
thy walks;
walks; and
and in
in my
my tongue
Thy sweet
sweet beloved
beloved name
name no
no more
more shall
shall dwell,
Lest I,
I, too
too much
much profane,
profane, should
should do
do it
it wrong,
And haply
haply of
of our
our old
old acquaintance
acquaintance tell.
For thee,
thee, against
against my
my self
self I'll
I'll vow
vow debate,
For I
I must
must ne'er
ne'er love
love him
him whom
whom thou
thou dost
dost hate.
Then hate
hate me
me when
when thou
thou wilt;
wilt; if
if ever,
ever, now;
Now, while
while the
the world
world is
is bent
bent my
my deeds
deeds to
to cross,
Join with
with the
the spite
spite of
of fortune,
fortune, make
make me
me bow,
And do
do not
not drop
drop in
in for
for an
an after-loss:
Ah! do
do not,
not, when
when my
my heart
heart hath
hath 'scap'd
'scap'd this
this sorrow,
Come in
in the
the rearward
rearward of
of a
a conquer'd
conquer'd woe;
Give not
not a
a windy
windy night
night a
a rainy
rainy morrow,
To linger
linger out
out a
a purpos'd
purpos'd overthrow.
If thou
thou wilt
wilt leave
leave me,
me, do
do not
not leave
leave me
me last,
When other
other petty
petty griefs
griefs have
have done
done their
their spite,
But in
in the
the onset

come: so
so shall
shall I
I taste
At first
first the
the very
very worst
worst of
of fortune's
fortune's might;
And other
other strains
strains of
of woe,

O! what

Happy to

But what's

The teeming

Bearing the

Like widow'd

Yet this

So thou

O truant

Then do

To make

My love

I love

That love

Our love
love was
was new,
new, and
and then
then but
but in
in the
the spring,
When I
I was
was wont
wont to
to greet
greet it
it with
with my
my lays;
As Philomel
Philomel in
in summer's
summer's front
front doth
doth sing,
And stops
stops her
her pipe
pipe in
in growth
growth of
of riper
riper days:
Not that
that the
the summer
summer is
is less
less pleasant
pleasant now
Than when
when her
her mournful
mournful hymns
hymns did
did hush
hush the
the night,
But that
that wild
wild music
music burthens
burthens every
every bough,
And sweets
sweets grown
grown common
common lose
lose their
their dear
dear delight.
Therefore like
like her,
her, I
I sometime
sometime hold
hold my
my tongue:
Because I
I would
would not
not dull
dull you
you with
with my
my song.
Alack! what
what poverty
poverty my
my Muse
Muse brings
brings forth,
That having
having such
such a

scope to

show her
her pride,
The argument,
argument, all
all bare,
bare, is
is of
of more
more worth
Than when
when it

O! blame
blame me
me not,
not, if
if I
I no
no more

can write!
Look in
in your
your glass,
glass, and
and there
there appears
appears a
a face
That over-goes
over-goes my
my blunt
blunt invention
invention quite,
Dulling my

and doing
doing me

Were it

sinful then,
then, striving

To mar

For to

Than of

And more,

Your own

To me,

For as
as you

first your

Such seems
seems your

beauty still.
still. Three
Three winters
winters cold,
Have from
from the

forests shook
shook three
three summers'
summers' pride,
Three beauteous
beauteous springs
springs to
to yellow
yellow autumn
autumn turn'd,
In process
process of
of the

seasons have
have I
I seen,
Three April
April perfumes
perfumes in
in three
three hot
hot Junes
Junes burn'd,
Since first
first I
I saw
saw you

fresh, which
which yet

are green.
Ah! yet
yet doth
doth beauty
beauty like
like a
a dial-hand,
Steal from
from his
his figure,
figure, and
and no
no pace
pace perceiv'd;
So your
your sweet
sweet hue,
hue, which
which methinks
methinks still
still doth

Hath motion,
motion, and
and mine
mine eye
eye may

be deceiv'd:
For fear
fear of
of which,
which, hear
hear this
this thou
thou age
age unbred:
Ere you
you were
were born
born was
was beauty's
beauty's summer
summer dead.
Let not
not my
my love
love be
be call'd
call'd idolatry,
Nor my
my beloved
beloved as
as an
an idol
idol show,
Since all
all alike
alike my
my songs
songs and
and praises
praises be
To one,
one, of
of one,
one, still
still such,
such, and
and ever
ever so.
Kind is
is my
my love
love to-day,
to-day, to-morrow
to-morrow kind,
Still constant
constant in
in a
a wondrous
wondrous excellence;
Therefore my
my verse
verse to
to constancy
constancy confin'd,
One thing
thing expressing,
expressing, leaves
leaves out
out difference.
'Fair, kind,
kind, and
and true,'
true,' is
is all
all my
my argument,
'Fair, kind,
kind, and
and true,'
true,' varying
varying to
to other
other words;
And in
in this
this change
change is
is my
my invention
invention spent,
Three themes
themes in
in one,
one, which
which wondrous
wondrous scope
scope affords.
Fair, kind,
kind, and
and true,
true, have
have often
often liv'd
liv'd alone,
Which three
three till
till now,
now, never
never kept
kept seat
seat in
in one.
When in
in the
the chronicle
chronicle of
of wasted
wasted time
I see
see descriptions
descriptions of
of the
the fairest
fairest wights,
And beauty
beauty making
making beautiful
beautiful old
old rime,
In praise
praise of
of ladies
ladies dead
dead and
and lovely
lovely knights,
Then, in
in the
the blazon
blazon of
of sweet
sweet beauty's
beauty's best,
Of hand,
hand, of
of foot,
foot, of
of lip,
lip, of
of eye,
eye, of
of brow,
I see
see their
their antique
antique pen
pen would
would have
have express'd
Even such
such a
a beauty
beauty as
as you
you master
master now.
So all
all their
their praises
praises are
are but
but prophecies
Of this
this our
our time,
time, all
all you
you prefiguring;
And for
for they
they looked
looked but
but with
with divining
divining eyes,
They had
had not
not skill
skill enough
enough your
your worth
worth to
to sing:
For we,
we, which
which now
now behold
behold these
these present
present days,
Have eyes
eyes to
to wonder,
wonder, but
but lack
lack tongues
tongues to
to praise.
Not mine
mine own
own fears,
fears, nor
nor the
the prophetic
prophetic soul
Of the
the wide
wide world
world dreaming
dreaming on
on things
things to
to come,
Can yet
yet the
the lease
lease of
of my
my true
true love
love control,
Supposed as
as forfeit
forfeit to
to a
a confin'd
confin'd doom.
The mortal
mortal moon
moon hath
hath her
her eclipse
eclipse endur'd,
And the
the sad
sad augurs
augurs mock
mock their
their own
own presage;
Incertainties now
now crown
crown themselves
themselves assur'd,
And peace
peace proclaims
proclaims olives
olives of
of endless
endless age.
Now with
with the
the drops
drops of
of this
this most
most balmy
balmy time,
My love
love looks
looks fresh,
fresh, and
and Death
Death to
to me
me subscribes,
Since, spite
spite of
of him,
him, I'll
I'll live
live in
in this
this poor
poor rime,
While he
he insults
insults o'er
o'er dull
dull and
and speechless
speechless tribes:
And thou
thou in
in this
this shalt
shalt find
find thy
thy monument,
When tyrants'
tyrants' crests
crests and
and tombs
tombs of
of brass
brass are
are spent.
What's in
in the
the brain,
brain, that
that ink
ink may
may character,
Which hath
hath not
not figur'd
figur'd to
to thee
thee my
my true
true spirit?
What's new
new to
to speak,
speak, what
what now
now to
to register,
That may
may express
express my
my love,
love, or
or thy
thy dear
dear merit?
Nothing, sweet
sweet boy;
boy; but
but yet,
yet, like
like prayers
prayers divine,
I must
must each
each day
day say
say o'er
o'er the
the very
very same;
Counting no
no old
old thing
thing old,
old, thou
thou mine,
mine, I
I thine,
Even as
as when
when first
first I
I hallow'd
hallow'd thy
thy fair
fair name.
So that
that eternal
eternal love
love in
in love's
love's fresh
fresh case,
Weighs not
not the
the dust
dust and
and injury
injury of
of age,
Nor gives
gives to
to necessary
necessary wrinkles
wrinkles place,
But makes
makes antiquity
antiquity for
for aye
aye his
his page;
Finding the
the first
first conceit
conceit of
of love
love there
there bred,
Where time
time and
and outward
outward form
form would
would show
show it
it dead.
O! never
never say

At such

Sland'ring creation

Yet so

That every

How oft

Upon that

With thy

The wiry

Do I

To kiss

Whilst my

At the

To be

would change
change their

And situation

O'er whom
whom thy

Making dead

Since saucy

Give them

My mistress'

I love

My mistress,

And yet

As any

Thou art

And to

A thousand

Thine eyes

To mourn

Then will

Beshrew that

For that

Is't not

Of him,

A torment

Prison my

But then

So, now

But thou

They know

Yet what

If eyes,

Be anchor'd

Why of

Whereto the

Why should

Which my

In things

And to

When my

I do

her though
though I
I know

That she
she might
might think

some untutor'd
untutor'd youth,
Unlearned in

Thus vainly
vainly thinking

that she

Although she
she knows

Simply I
I credit

On both

But wherefore

And wherefore
wherefore say

O! love's
love's best
best habit
habit is
is in
in seeming
seeming trust,
And age
age in

Therefore I

lie with

And in

O! call

That thy

Wound me

Use power

slay me

Tell me
me thou

Dear heart,

Is more

Let me

thee: ah!
ah! my

well knows
Her pretty
pretty looks
looks have

been mine
mine enemies;
And therefore
therefore from
from my
my face
face she
she turns
turns my
my foes,
That they
they elsewhere

dart their

Yet do
do not
not so;
so; but
but since
since I
I am
am near
near slain,
Kill me
me outright
outright with
with looks,
looks, and
and rid
rid my

Be wise
wise as
as thou
thou art

cruel; do
do not
not press
My tongue-tied
tongue-tied patience
patience with

Lest sorrow

The manner

If I

Though not

As testy

And in

Now this

In faith

Hate of

O! but

Lo, as

housewife runs

One of

Sets down
down her

swift dispatch
In pursuit
pursuit of

Whilst her

in chase,
Cries to
to catch

To follow

Not prizing

So runn'st

And play

So will

If thou

Two loves
loves I
I have

comfort and

Which like

me still:
The better
better angel
angel is
is a
a man
man right
right fair,
The worser
worser spirit
spirit a
a woman
woman colour'd
colour'd ill.
To win
win me
me soon
soon to
to hell,
hell, my
my female
female evil,
Tempteth my
my better
better angel
angel from
from my
my side,
And would
would corrupt
corrupt my
my saint
saint to
to be
be a
a devil,
Wooing his
his purity
purity with
with her
her foul
foul pride.
And whether
whether that
that my
my angel
angel be
be turn'd
turn'd fiend,
Suspect I
I may,
may, yet
yet not
not directly
directly tell;
But being
being both
both from
from me,
me, both
both to
to each
each friend,
I guess
guess one
one angel
angel in
in another's
another's hell:
Yet this
this shall
shall I
I ne'er
ne'er know,
know, but
but live
live in
in doubt,
Till my
my bad
bad angel
angel fire
fire my
my good

one out.
Those lips

Breathed forth

To me

But when

Straight in

Chiding that

Color is a property of objects that our minds create - an interpretation. This interpretation helps us acquire knowledge about the properties of surfaces. To construct colors, our subconscious mind analyzes ratios of the signals from photoreceptors in the retina. We take our ability to see color for most of us for granted, yet it is a highly complex process that begs the question of whether the "red" or "blue" we see is the same "red" or "blue" that others see. With all the beauty in color there is a small population who is color blind to some colors.
A third problem has been the failure to describe the very important effects of strong luminance (lightness) contrasts in the appearance of colors reflected from a surface (such as paints or inks) as opposed to colors of light; "colors" such as browns or ochres cannot appear in mixtures of light. Thus, a strong lightness contrast between a mid-valued yellow paint and a surrounding bright white makes the yellow appear to be green or brown, while a strong brightness contrast between a rainbow and the surrounding sky makes the yellow in a rainbow appear to be a fainter yellow, or white.

With all the beauty in color there is a small population who is color blind to some colors.
The most important problem has been a confusion between the behavior of light mixtures, called additive color, and the behavior of paint, ink, dye, or pigment mixtures, called subtractive color. This problem arises because the absorption of light by material substances follows different rules from the perception of light by the eye.

The color process is a far more complicated than just a recording of wavelengths of light rays that reaches our eyes.
