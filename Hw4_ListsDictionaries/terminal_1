This climate is found near the equator. That means that there is more 
direct sunlight hitting the land and sea there than anywhere else. The 
sun warms the land and sea and the water evaporates into the air. The 
warm air can hold a lot of water vapor. As the air rises, it cools. That 
means it can hold less water vapor. Then as warm meets cold, 
condensation takes place and the vapor forms droplets and clouds form. 
The clouds then produce rain. It rains more than ninety days a year and 
the strong sun usually shines between the storms. The water cycle 
repeats often along the equator.

I live in a tropical country blessed by God It is good for nature 
rather than beauty, in February, in February It has carnival, it has 
carnival, I have a VW beetle and a guitar I support Flamengo and I have 
a girlfriend named Tereza Child of samba, I am a boy of ordinary 
outlook But happy all the same because I don't owe anything to anybody 
Because I am happy, very happy, with myself alone. Child of samba child 
of samba I may not be a band leader, it's true But at home all my 
friends look up to me, it's true And that is why I can do anything and 
the reason for my joy.

This climate is found near the equator. That means that there is more 
direct sunlight hitting the land and sea there than anywhere else. The 
sun warms the land and sea and the water evaporates into the air. The 
warm air can hold a lot of water vapor. As the air rises, it cools. That 
means it can hold less water vapor. Then as warm meets cold, 
condensation takes place and the vapor forms droplets and clouds form. 
The clouds then produce rain. It rains more than ninety days a year and 
the strong sun usually shines between the storms. The water cycle 
repeats often along the equator.

I live in a tropical country blessed by God It is good for nature 
rather than beauty, in February, in February It has carnival, it has 
carnival, I have a VW beetle and a guitar I support Flamengo and I have 
a girlfriend named Tereza Child of samba, I am a boy of ordinary 
outlook But happy all the same because I don't owe anything to anybody 
Because I am happy, very happy, with myself alone. Child of samba child 
of samba I may not be a band leader, it's true But at home all my 
friends look up to me, it's true And that is why I can do anything and 
the reason for my joy.
