This climate is found near the equator. That means that there is more 
direct sunlight hitting the land and sea there than anywhere else. The 
sun warms the land and sea and the water evaporates into the air. The 
warm air can hold a lot of water vapor. As the air rises, it cools. That 
means it can hold less water vapor. Then as warm meets cold, 
condensation takes place and the vapor forms droplets and clouds form. 
The clouds then produce rain. It rains more than ninety days a year and 
the strong sun usually shines between the storms. The water cycle 
repeats often along the equator.
