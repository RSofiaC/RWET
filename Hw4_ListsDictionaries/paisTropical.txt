I live in a tropical country blessed by God It is good for nature 
rather than beauty, in February, in February It has carnival, it has 
carnival, I have a VW beetle and a guitar I support Flamengo and I have 
a girlfriend named Tereza Child of samba, I am a boy of ordinary 
outlook But happy all the same because I don't owe anything to anybody 
Because I am happy, very happy, with myself alone. Child of samba child 
of samba I may not be a band leader, it's true But at home all my 
friends look up to me, it's true And that is why I can do anything and 
the reason for my joy.
