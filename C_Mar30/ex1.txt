Two roads
roads diverged
diverged in
in a
a yellow
yellow wood,
And sorry
sorry I
I could
could not
not travel
travel both
And be
be one
one traveler,
traveler, long
long I
I stood
And looked
looked down
down one
one as
as far
far as
as I
I could
To where
where it
it bent
bent in
in the
the undergrowth;
Then took
took the
the other,
other, as
as just
just as
as fair,
And having
having perhaps
perhaps the
the better
better claim,
Because it
it was
was grassy
grassy and
and wanted
wanted wear;
Though as
as for
for that
that the
the passing
passing there
Had worn
worn them
them really
really about
about the
the same,
And both
both that
that morning
morning equally
equally lay
In leaves
leaves no
no step
step had
had trodden
trodden black.
Oh, I
I kept
kept the
the first
first for
for another
another day!
Yet knowing
knowing how
how way
way leads
leads on
on to
to way,
I doubted
doubted if
if I
I should
should ever
ever come
come back.
I shall
shall be
be telling
telling this
this with
with a
a sigh
Somewhere ages
ages and
and ages
ages hence:
Two roads
roads diverged
diverged in
in a
a wood,
wood, and
and Iâ€”
I took
took the
the one
one less
less travelled
travelled by,
And that
that has
has made
made all
all the
the difference.
