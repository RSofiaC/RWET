The guard wont let me through.I’m past the age limit.I come from a country that no longer exists.My documents don’t meet the requirements.I’m missing a stamp.I need another signature.I don’t speak the language.I don’t have a bank account.I failed the admission test.My position in the great factory has been cancelled.I got unemployed today and forever.I have no contacts at all.I’ve been in this world for too long.our masters deem it is time for me to shut up and scram
