If so, dear Honorable Immigration Judge, my question to you is, how can I go on teaching about equal rights and freedom of speech and all the things our constitution is supposed to defend, and that the very name of our school is supposed to represent, when the father of my students is deported simply because his skin is darker? Both my Latino and white students are U.S. citizens. So how do I explain to the class that one has the right to a family in the United States and the other citizens do not? Do you think they’ll understand why Felipe and Gerardo’s parents cannot gain citizenship in a country in which they’ve lived for 20 years and in which their children were born, yet it is all right for U.S. citizens to buy up all the beach front property in the Espinozas’ motherland? Do you think such an incident is going to convince my students and their families that the United States is the compassionate model of democracy for the rest of the world? ˇWhy should we be deported? This is very, very hard for a family. What will our fellow citizens think if honest subjects are faced with such a decree? not to mention the great material losses it would incur. I would like to become a Bavarian citizen again.
