Fear would never show up
The party would not end early
People wouldn’t be clapping for the wrong reasons
I would do it so it felt real
I could enjoy the warmth of my bridges burning
There would be something to believe in
We would enjoy the blissfulness of our insanity
Being alone wouldn’t feel as such of a fatal destiny
The person in the mirror wouldn’t feel as a stranger anymore
